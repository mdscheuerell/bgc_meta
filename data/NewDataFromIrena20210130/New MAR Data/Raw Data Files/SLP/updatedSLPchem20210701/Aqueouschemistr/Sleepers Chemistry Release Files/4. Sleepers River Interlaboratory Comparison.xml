      <abstract>Three of our laboratories, which account for ~60-percent of our analytical data, have participated in the U.S. Geological Survey Standard Reference Sample project (Round Robin) laboratory intercomparison. The Round Robin is a semi-annual sample program in which more than 100 laboratories in the U.S. analyze up to 5 sets of reference samples, depending on laboratory focus and concentration ranges. Results are collated and compared to expected values to assess individual laboratory performance. This table summarizes the performance of these three laboratories for the most common analytes.  Chemical analysis performance metrics for the other 15 laboratories used during this project can be found in "3. Sleepers River Laboratory Information.csv," "5. Sleepers River Replicate Statistics.csv," and "6. Sleepers River Blank Statistics.csv."</abstract>
      <purpose>Laboratory accuracy is of paramount importance and this program is an established way to track performance and identify any issues with specific analytes. </purpose>

        <procdesc>	Table "4. Sleepers River Interlaboratory Comparison.csv" presents summary statistics of USGS Round Robin interlaboratory comparisons conducted for three of the laboratories used by this project: the U.S. Forest Service Laboratory at Durham, NH (Fall 2012 to Spring 2020), the USGS Water Energy and Biogeochemical Budgets Laboratory at Boulder, CO (Fall 2007 to Spring 2017), and the U.S. Forest Service Laboratory at Grand Rapids, MN (Fall 2018-Spring 2020). Corresponding USGS Round Robin ID's are 560, 238, and 591 respectively.  Anywhere from 5-58 additional laboratories participated in the comparisons summarized by this table.  Original Round Robin results can be downloaded directly from the USGS (https://bqs.usgs.gov/srs/). 
	Mean relative percent difference ("Mean_RPD") is calculated as ( |Reported Value-Most Probable Value| / (Reported Value + Most Probable Value) /2 ) X 100. Median percent error ("Median_PE") is calculated as ( (Reported Value - Most Probable Value) / Most Probable Value ) X 100.  Note that PE is actually reported as "Pct Diff" in the original Round Robin results and what we define as "Mean_RPD" here, is not reported in the original Round Robin results at all. They are named and calculated as such to be consistent with "5. Sleepers River Replicate Statistics.csv" and to better reflect the conventional definitions of percent error and percent difference.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>	This table presents summary statistics by analyte of USGS Round Robin interlaboratory comparisons conducted for three of the laboratories used by this project. Though chemistry data in "1. Sleepers River Aqueous Chemistry.csv" were assembled from 18 laboratories, these three laboratories accounted for ~60-percent of the analyses. These statistics could be considered a snapshot of performance at these particular laboratories. 
	 Mean_RPDs or Median_PEs greater than 10% indicate poor laboratory performance except for sodium, sulfate, and total nitrogen analyzed at the Durham laboratory, for which high Mean_RPDs or Median_PEs  occur because measured values are close to their reporting limits.
	Additional metrics of chemical analysis performance can be found in "3. Sleepers River Laboratory Information.csv," "5. Sleepers River Replicate Statistics.csv," and "6. Sleepers River Blank Statistics.csv."  </eaover>
