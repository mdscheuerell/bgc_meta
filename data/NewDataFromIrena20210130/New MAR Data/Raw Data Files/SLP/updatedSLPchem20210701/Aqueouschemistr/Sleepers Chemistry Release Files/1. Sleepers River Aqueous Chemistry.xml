      <abstract>	Aqueous chemistry and isotopic composition are at the core of research at Sleepers River research watershed. Trends in atmospheric deposition chemistry reveal whether and to what extent clean air legislation is working. Trends in stream chemistry reveal whether changes in atmospheric chemistry translate to the stream, or whether the terrestrial landscape modulates change. Changes in chemistry as water moves from the atmosphere through the soil and into the shallow and deeper groundwater aquifers on its way to the stream illustrate how soils and underlying glacial deposits act to influence chemistry, for example which solutes are added, removed, or transformed. The degree to which solutes from different hydrologic compartments mix indicates how much streamflow derives from subsurface versus surficial sources, and the isotopic composition of these waters provides additional constraints to infer sources. The accumulated chemical data presented here represent a nearly 30-year effort to characterize these various waters, document how they change at the event, seasonal, and long-term scales, and also how they scale spatially as one moves from the headwater catchment to larger order streams, where land cover also changes from strictly forested to partially agricultural and residential. </abstract>
      <purpose>The chemical and isotopic dataset assembled from 18 different laboratories over nearly 30 years has been organized, rigorously cross-checked and quality-controlled, and assembled in one place for public availability and use in investigations of biogeochemical processes and trends.</purpose>

        <procdesc>1. Sample collection  
	The method of sample collection depended on the sample type. All samples were kept chilled after collection and brought to the laboratory for processing and shipping.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20210405</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.1 Precipitation 
	We collected two types of precipitation (Sample_Type = PW or PE): bulk deposition and wet-only deposition.  The two adjacent collectors are not distinguished by sample type code (Sample_Type), but rather by ID number range (SSN), as described in the “Overview Description” section of this metadata.  A bulk deposition collector is always open to the atmosphere and accordingly collects some amount of dry deposition but may also collect unwanted organic material from the forest canopy, including pollen, and insects. We used a “Hubbard Brook” collector, which has a 203-millimeter (mm) diameter funnel leading to a vented collection bottle.  A loop in the tubing serves as a vapor lock to limit evaporation. For wet-only precipitation, we used an AerocheMetrics wetfall/dryfall collector. The collection bucket is covered when it is not raining. It is triggered to open by precipitation and to close when precipitation stops. Both types were collected at a weekly time step, with occasional more frequent sampling of the wet-only precipitation when collected on an “event” basis. On collection, samples were weighed to calculate collector catch for comparison to precipitation gages, then poured into clean polyethylene bottles. The collection bottle (bulk) and bucket (wet-only) were replaced with clean ones. 
	Special accommodations were made for dormant season sampling when most precipitation falls as snow. From mid-November through mid-April, the bulk deposition rain sampler was replaced by an open bucket. If the buckets contained snow or ice at collection time, they were sealed and thawed back in the office until completely liquid before drawing off the sample.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.2. Snowpack 
	Two types of snowpack samples were collected. Snow cores (Sample_Type = SC) represented an integrated sample of the entire snowpack, collected by a 102-centimeter (cm) diameter coring device (snow tube). The other type was a snow profile (Sample_Type = SP), where discrete layers of the snowpack were sampled from a snow pit using a clean stainless-steel spatula. In both cases, samples were placed in zip-lock bags and returned to the office for melting before pouring the sample. </procdesc>
        <procdate>20210405</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.3. Meltwater
	Water draining from the snowpack due to thawing or rain-on-snow (Sample_Type = SM) was collected by snowmelt lysimeters. The lysimeters were sited on slight slopes for drainage and placed on the forest floor prior to the winter season. We used different designs in different years, but they were generally constructed of plexiglass or thick plastic sheeting draped over a PVC frame, with a footprint of approximately 0.5-square-meters. In all cases the lysimeters had 10- to 20-cm high walls that helped limit but did not exclude lateral gains or losses. The walls helped contain the meltwater so that it flowed along the floor of the lysimeter to a drain on the downslope edge. The drain led via a 38-mm PVC pipe to a covered collection bucket downslope. The melt lysimeters worked well during the main melt sequence, but sometimes experienced temporary plugging of the drains by ice in early melt periods when a thaw was frequently followed by a quick, hard freeze.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.4. Soil water
	Soil water from the unsaturated zone, or vadose water (Sample_Type = VW), was sampled using zero-tension lysimeters installed in the fall of 1991. They were installed in three soil pits along a hillslope transect at lower, middle, and upper hillslope positions, at two or three depths each (for depths, see names starting with "LYS" in the "Sample_Name" column of "2. Sleepers River Site Descriptions.csv"). The lysimeters were machined from polypropylene and assembled by plastic welding. Soil water was intercepted by 152-mm diameter shallow “cups”, shaped using a laboratory watch glass as a mold. At each hillslope position and for each lysimeter depth, three cups were installed into the uphill side of a large soil pit with tubing from each cup ported into a common collection vessel below. Two additional ports, one each for sampling and venting, were fitted with rigid small diameter tubing that extended upward about one meter above land surface. The collection vessel held about 4 liters. The sampling tube extended to the concave bottom of the vessel, allowing complete evacuation of the water. The deepest lysimeter in each position, and both of the two lysimeters at the lower hillslope, were sometimes overtopped by rising groundwater tables, especially during snowmelt. There is a set of isotope samples from suction lysimeters that were briefly deployed during snowmelt 1994. </procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.5. Groundwater
	Groundwater (Sample_Type = GW) was sampled from a network of wells within W-9, and some outside W-9. The original network of ~ 40 wells (designated BW in Sample_Name; Thomas, 1992) were installed in the summer of 1991 using a gas-powered auger rig with a hitch, but for W-9, which is entirely roadless, we moved it around with a horse in place of the standard pick-up truck. Wells were placed in a variety of landscape positions, and in all cases were drilled to refusal. We interpreted this as bedrock based on repeatability of refusal depth across a few meters in a given area. Depth to refusal was 1 to 4 meters (m) and the overburden was dense fine-silty glacial till with about 50 cm of soil. The augur diameter was 102 mm and the well diameter was 51 mm. The PVC wells were assembled with 1.6 m of screen at the bottom. A “sock” of permeable fabric was placed around each screen and filled with native fine sand from the nearest stream channel, and a flexible rubber packer was clamped around the well just above the screen. After inserting, till was tamped down around the annulus above the packer up to land surface. The wells were developed by iteratively filling with streamwater, plunging, and purging.
	Additional wells and piezometers (designated T, K, M, and P in Sample_Name) were installed by hand auguring at the near exact diameter of the well and tapping them in. The T-wells (Smith, 1997) were also 51-mm diameter and were installed in two nests of three each, with shorter (0.6-m) screens to capture discrete depth intervals. The T wells became part of the regular sampling network. 
	The other wells and piezometers were 25- or 38-mm diameter and were installed for short-term studies. The K wells (Kendall et al., 1999) were placed next to existing BW wells to form nests. The M piezometers (McGlynn et al., 1999) were also in nests, along a hillslope to riparian transect. The P piezometers (Hjerdt, 2002) were placed in hillslope hollows and along upper headwater stream riparian zones. 
	Wells were sampled by peristaltic pump, by first purging the well until dry or the equivalent of three well volumes was removed. When sufficiently recharged, the well was sampled into a polyethylene bottle, after three rinses with sample water. </procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.6. Overland flow and groundwater seeps
	Saturation-excess overland flow (Sample_Type = OF) was sampled in two ways. It was sometimes sampled directly with a bottle where it emanated from the ground (as return flow) or other easily sampled place under very wet conditions (usually snowmelt). Alternatively, it was sampled by pumping from shallow cups--60-milliliter (mL) polyethylene bottles cut in half with small holes drilled near the top for water entry--installed to be flush with land surface. The cups were installed in areas that were frequently saturated. Thus, water flowing over land surface could enter over the top, but the cup also captured the very shallowest groundwater through the drilled holes, and the cup served as a reservoir for collection and sampling. Seeps that were more permanent features were sampled directly by bottle and are designated as groundwater seeps (Sample_Type = GWS).</procdesc>
        <procdate>20210405</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>1.7. Streamwater
	Streamwater (Sample_Type = ST) was sampled either by a manual grab (Method_Type = M) or by an automatic ISCO sampler (Method_Type = A). Manual grab samples are collected directly from the flowing stream in 500-mL high-density polyethylene bottles. The bottle was rinsed three times with sample water before filling completely (no head space).
	Automatic samples have been collected throughout the study at the forested 41-hectare (ha) headwater catchment W-9, and occasionally during short-term deployments at the three main upstream tributaries to W-9: W-9A, W-9B, and W-9C. Automated sampling also occurred at the larger downstream nested sites, 837-ha W-3 (Pope Brook, USGS gage 01135150) and 11,125-ha W-5 (Sleepers River USGS gage 01135300), as well as the 59-ha agricultural catchment W-2.  At W-9 and its upstream tributaries, the sampler was controlled by a data logger that triggers the sampler based on initial and subsequent incremental changes in stream stage, designed for comprehensive coverage over the storm hydrograph. At other sites, sampling was controlled by the controller on the unit, which allows setting of a start time and sampling interval. The sampler has a carousel with 24 wedge shaped bottles arranged in a circle. A removable control module / reversible peristaltic pump assembly sits over the carousel, with a spout that rotates to fill each bottle in turn. The sampler sits beside the stream, and tubing leads from the sampler to a strainer/intake in the centroid of flow, secured above the stream bed. Each sample is collected during a cycle that starts with purging the line (pumping toward the stream), then rinsing the line (pumping water into the tubing just up to the pump), purging the rinse water, pumping water through and filling the sample bottle, followed by a final purge. The ISCO records sample times. Samples were collected generally within 48 hours, with greater urgency during warmer times of the year. The ISCO bottles were either capped and returned to the laboratory (always returned if partly frozen) or poured into 500 mL sample bottles on site. The ISCO bottles were replaced with clean ones. </procdesc>

        <procdesc>2. Sample processing
	In this project we had a strong focus on event sampling, where we were collecting several hydrologic compartments over short time steps, most often by a person working alone. Also, a significant portion of our work was done in near- or sub-freezing weather. Because of these two factors, we usually sampled by “grab and go”, and processed the samples back in the laboratory within 24 hours. The 500-mL samples were filtered (0.45-micrometer (µm) polyethersulfone (PES)) and split into smaller aliquots, typically separate polyethylene bottles for cations, anions, alkalinity, a 60-mL glass amber bottle for dissolved organic carbon(DOC) and Ultraviolet Absorbance (UVA), and a 12-mL glass vial with conical cap to displace any headspace air for water isotopes. Samples (except water isotopes) were kept chilled until processing and were shipped chilled to the appropriate laboratory. The water isotope vials store well and were archived at room temperature until analysis. </procdesc>

        <procdesc>3. Chemical analysis
	During the 28 years covered here, we used 18 different laboratories to analyze up to 33 chemical and isotopic constituents resulting in ~14,000 sample records. Chemical and isotopic data are all reported in "1. Sleepers River Aqueous Chemistry.csv."</procdesc>

Sleepers River Laboratory Information.csv," "4. Sleepers River Interlaboratory Comparison.csv," "5. Sleepers River Replicate Statistics.csv," and "6. Sleepers River Blank Statistics.csv."  The review and screening of individual sample chemistry is described below.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20210405</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>4.1. Screening Chemistry Data
	We used several diagnostic tools to screen chemical and isotopic data for bad values: visual reviews using an assortment of plots, outlier identification and examination, charge balance checks, concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships, concentration-concentration relationships, comparison among like sample sites and like sample types, comparisons within individual sites across time, field note review, interlaboratory comparisons, and laboratory correspondence. Generally, we were conservative with data censorship, wishing to avoid removal of data resulting from real phenomena. No data points were removed unless at least two people agreed. We worked as a team, using interactive plots to apply several of these methods iteratively to assess any given analysis from several different perspectives. If a chemical constituent was flagged for unusual behavior but ultimately kept as real data, it was noted in the “Chemistry_Flag” column.  Users may decide to keep or reject these samples for their purposes.
	For stream data, we examined time series and C-Q plots for outliers. We did not reject outliers outright, recognizing that they could be real, but looked at additional diagnostics.  For example, calcium (Ca) and alkalinity (ANC) typically matched within about 10-percent so we would allow them to stand as outliers if this condition were met, or if they lined up on the typically linear magnesium (Mg) vs. Ca plot.  For precipitation data, we examined time series, checked chemistry against sample volume, and vetted the field and laboratory comments of outlier samples carefully-any mention of sample contamination usually resulted in the removal of said outlier.  For subsurface samples, we plotted a given analyte across multiple sites and examined extreme high and low values. We let them stand if supported by other values, for example, a similar outlier at another site on the same day.  Other checks included screening outliers on DOC vs. UVA at 250 nanometers (UV254) plots, rejecting a high DOC anomaly if not supported by high dissolved organic nitrogen, and considering whether the sum of nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) was less than total dissolved nitrogen (TDN).  For samples with complete chemistry we looked for charge balance within 10-percent.  If a sample failed, we kept values that passed other diagnostics, such as C-Q relationships, and rejected those that did not.
	The continuity of the U.S. Forest Service Durham laboratory (hereafter Durham) for the weekly precipitation and W-9 stream chemistry over the duration of the study often overlapped with other project sampling resulting in replicate analyses from two different labs.  This allowed us to remove outliers in one time series where not supported by an outlier in the other time series. The continuous Durham record also served as a benchmark against which to compare the various other labs. For example, 2 years of stream sodium data and 3 years of stream pH, each from specific labs, were removed due to clear departure from the Durham values. We plotted data using laboratory source as a factor, screening for laboratory biases and we also checked for continuity across the date of documented laboratory method changes in time series plots of each analyte.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>1. Table Structure  
	Chemistry data are sorted by date-time (Date_Time) and sample serial number (SSN). Each water sample is identified by a unique SSN, and chemistry for each sample is reported by row.  Any row with a value in the "SSN" field has reported chemistry. However, seldom were all the chemical constituents reported in the table analyzed for a given sample. A missing analyte is reported as "NA". An "NA" in the "SSN" field indicates a dummy row with no associated chemistry and are included in order to provide a complete record of approximately weekly precipitation amounts. These dummy rows will only have values in columns "W9_Flow_mm.hr," "Precip_Type,"  "Precip_Start," "Precip_Collect," and "Precip_Depth_mm" (see section 5 for more detail).
	Regular weekly W-9 precipitation and stream samples were analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service laboratory in Durham, NH (hereafter Durham). Durham samples have been retroactively assigned SSNs beginning at 50,000. These Durham   samples often serve as replicates to samples analyzed by 17 other laboratories used on a by-project basis throughout the 30-year period of record.  The chemistry dataset assembled from these 17 laboratories includes more event-based sampling than the Durham chemistry and unlike Durham, which only analyzed W-9 samples, includes many more sample types and locations. The Durham dataset has the advantage of being virtually complete through time and keeping the same laboratory throughout. It can be isolated simply by filtering the "SSN" column for numbers equal to or greater than 50,000 or by sorting the entire table by the "SSN" column.
	Please note that analysis results less than the detection limit (DL) are posted as the negative value of the detection limit. Doing so keeps the column numeric while indicating the operative detection limit. However, negative ANC, temperature, and isotopic values are valid as is and have no DL. A summary of detections limits by laboratory and analyte can be found in "3. Sleepers River Laboratory Information.csv."  Also note that "NA" is reported whenever any value for any column is unavailable.

2. Sample Information
	Samples are uniquely identified by their SSN and further described by the columns "Sample_Name," "Sample_Type," "Sample_Method," and "Date_Time" . Type and method are defined in the "Entity and Attribute" portion of this metadata file. The sample name is a standardized name created for the site in the watershed where the sample was collected and is further described in the file "2. Sleepers River Site Descriptions.csv."
	The "Replicate" column indicates whether a sample has a replicate. If any given sample reads "Yes" in the "Replicate" field then another sample with the same name and type, and a collection time within 3 minutes to 4 hours of the other (depending on sample type), is also reported in the table. This occurs when a sample for another laboratory was taken concurrently with a Durham sample. It should be noted that though the samples are in duplicate, they are analyzed by two different laboratories, one that remains the same through the record (Durham), and one that varies on a by-project basis. Field replicates analyzed by the same laboratory were also collected and reviewed but are reported as averages here and are not flagged in the "Replicate" column.   Summary statistics for both replicate types can be found in "5. Sleepers River Replicate Statistics.csv."
	The "Chemistry_Flag" column lists any chemical constituent reported for a given sample that was flagged for abnormal behavior during chemistry screening but ultimately kept as real data. For more details on chemistry screening techniques see "Process Step" section 4.1 in this metadata.

3. Hydrologic Information
	In this data release, streamflow is reported in two different forms; as specific discharge, or flow per unit area, in units of millimeters per hour (mm/hr) and as discharge (flow) in units of cubic feet per second (cfs). Both are reported as instantaneous readings at the time of sample collection. The columns "W9_Specific_Discharge_mm.hr" and "W9_Flow_cfs" report W-9 instantaneous discharge and specific discharge at the time of sample collection. This allows for the easy construction of concentration-discharge relationships for W-9 stream chemistry and flow. Note that W-9 instantaneous discharge and specific discharge are reported for every sample in the dataset regardless of sample name or type as a general indicator of hydrological conditions at the time of sampling. The columns "Specific_Discharge_mm.hr" and "Flow_mm.hr" report instantaneous discharge for streams W-9, W-3, and W-5. For example, for a W-9 sample, the same number will appear in both the "W9_Flow_cfs" and "Flow_cfs" columns whereas for a W-3 sample, W-9 flow will appear in the "W9_Flow_cfs" column and W-3 flow will appear in the "Flow_cfs" column. A complete record of 5-minute W-9 flow (USGS station 01135100 POPE BROOK TRIBUTARY (W-9), NR NORTH DANVILLE, VT)  has been published as a data release and is cross-referenced in this metadata file. W-3 (USGS station 01135150 POPE BROOK (W-3), NR NORTH DANVILLE, VT) and W-5 (USGS station 01135300 SLEEPERS RIVER (W-5), NR ST. JONHSBURY, VT) flow data are available at the following links:

https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=01135150 (W-3)
https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=01135300 (W-5)

Other columns   reporting hydrologic data are "Well_Level_m," "Snow_Core_Depth_cm," "Snow_Profile_Depth_Low_cm," and "Snow_Profile_Depth_High_cm" and are described under the "Entity and Attribute Information" section of this metadata file.
 
4. Chemical concentrations and isotopic composition
	Analyses for up to 33 chemical and isotopic constituents are reported for each sample in this table. All chemical analyses are for filtered samples.  Each chemical constituent has two columns, one that reports analytical concentration or isotopic composition, and one that reports the laboratory where the analysis occurred as a number. This number uniquely identifies the laboratory and corresponds to the "Laboratory_Key" column in "3. Sleepers River Laboratory Information.csv" where additional information such as laboratory name, detection limit, analytical method, and method precision is reported. The chemical concentration and isotopic composition columns are grouped together and are sorted alphabetically, except for SUVA, which is last in the group. The laboratory source columns are also grouped together, each one always 33 columns to the right of its corresponding analytical value column, except for SUVA which has no laboratory source because it is calculated, not measured. The laboratory source columns share the same name as the analytical values columns but have the added suffix of "_Lab." 
	We reported laboratory source in this table because the chemical and isotopic data presented here have been assembled from so many different laboratories. As discussed in "Process Step" section 4.1 , we screened our data for systematic laboratory biases but still, the range of labs, sometimes using different methods, introduce a variability to the data that we wanted to present as transparently as possible to the users. Reporting the lab sources as numbers allows users to easily include it as a factor in their analyses as we did.

5. Precipitation Information
	Precipitation samples were collected at watershed W-9 and are indicated by the site named “R-29 (PPT@W-9).” Columns "Precip_Type," "Precip_Start," "Precip_Collect," and "Precip_Depth_ mm" are reported for precipitation samples. There are two sets of precipitation time series, as indicated by “Precip_Type”: "USFS Durham" or "Other Labs." Depth is reported so that precipitation chemistry can be paired with precipitation amount. "USFS Durham" precipitation samples were collected on a roughly weekly basis, as indicated by the time interval defined by the start and collect columns and by the "PW" "Sample Type" designation. "Other Labs" precipitation samples were also collected on a weekly basis but episodic event-based sampling also occurs throughout the record, interrupting routine weekly sampling. Event-based precipitation samples are indicated by a sub-weekly time interval and by the "PE" "Sample_Type" designation. The precipitation start (Precip_Start) and collect (Precip_Collect) columns create a continuous record of the weekly and sub-weekly precipitation amounts. If a sample was not collected or analyzed due to low rainfall, sample contamination, or sample loss, the continuous record is maintained using a dummy row in which only columns "W9_Flow_mm.hr," "Precip_Type," "Precip_Start," "Precip_Collect," and "Precip_Depth_ mm" are populated. To filter for this continuous record of approximately weekly W-9 rainfall amount follow these steps: 
1. Select "R-29 (PPT@W-9) " in the "Sample_Name" column to isolate W-9 precipitation samples. 
2. Select either "USFS Durham" or "Other Labs" in the "Precip_Type" column. Because Durham and other laboratory samples overlap, two continuous record series were created, one for Durham and one for the aggregated "other" labs. Recall that Durham samples are strictly weekly (PW), while the aggregate lab samples are weekly (PW) plus event (PE), where the latter replace a regular weekly sample with two or more events. In a small number of cases, event samples are further split into incremental (PI) samples, which are subsamples within a single rain event.
3. Sort the filtered data by the "Precip_Start" column to ensure they are in temporal sequence.
